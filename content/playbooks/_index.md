# Playbooks

Repeatable workflows for getting consistent, high-quality outcomes from AI. Each playbook covers a specific task — writing, research, thinking, review — and gives you a step-by-step process that works every time, not just when you get lucky with a prompt.

Every playbook follows the same structure: an **overview** of what it does and why, **when to use** it, **the play** itself as a sequence of concrete steps, **related playbooks** that connect to it, and **examples**.

- [AI Driven Writing]({{< relref "ai-driven-writing" >}}) — Go from thesis to outline to filled content, keeping the human in control of the thinking at every stage.

- [Automated Journaling]({{< relref "automated-journaling" >}})
- [Decision Documentation]({{< relref "decision-documentation" >}})
- [Generating Speaker Notes]({{< relref "generating-speaker-notes" >}})
- [Generating Variations]({{< relref "generating-variations" >}})
- [Knowledge Digest]({{< relref "knowledge-digest" >}}) — Learn any material by answering questions — AI teaches by pulling out understanding, not pouring in information.
- [Research Assistant]({{< relref "research-assistant" >}}) — Targeted research synthesis for a specific purpose, turning raw sources into actionable preparation.
- [Rubber Duck with Memory]({{< relref "rubber-duck-with-memory" >}}) — Think out loud with an AI that asks good questions and writes everything down.
- [Rubric Driven Assessment]({{< relref "rubric-driven-assessment" >}}) — Codify your thinking into a concrete rubric, then let AI apply it consistently as your work evolves.
- [Secondary AI Review]({{< relref "secondary-ai-review" >}}) — Use a fresh AI session to catch the patterns and tics that accumulate when AI helps you write.
- [SOP / Process Documentation]({{< relref "sop-process-documentation" >}})
