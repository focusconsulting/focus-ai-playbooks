## What It Is

Everyone on the team has access to Claude through a shared team account managed by Anthropic. This is your primary AI tool and the foundation for everything else in this section.

## Getting Started

Log in with SSO and request a seat. Yes, Anthropic's SSO experience is rough around the edges. Stick with it.

Once you have access, you can use Claude through the web interface at claude.ai or through Claude Desktop. The team account gives you access to the latest models and higher usage limits than a personal account.

## When to Use It

This is less of a "when" and more of a "make sure you have it." The team account is what gives you access to Claude Desktop, Claude Projects, and Claude Co-working. If you haven't set it up yet, do it today.
