## What It Is

Claude Code is a command-line tool that brings AI into your development workflow directly from the terminal. It can generate code, debug issues, refactor existing code, explore unfamiliar codebases, and help with architecture decisions.

## Getting Started

Claude Code is available through your team account. Install it and authenticate with your team credentials. It runs in your terminal and works with your local files and repositories.

## When to Use It

Claude Code is for engineering work. If you write code as part of your job, this is the tool to learn. Some common uses:

Generating code from a description of what you need, then reviewing and refining the output.

Debugging issues by giving Claude Code the error, the relevant code, and the context around what you were trying to do.

Exploring an unfamiliar codebase by asking Claude Code to explain how components connect, what a function does, or where a particular behavior lives.

Refactoring existing code with specific goals like improving readability, extracting shared logic, or updating patterns.

There are already dedicated playbooks for AI-driven development with Claude Code that go deeper on these workflows. If you're on the engineering team and haven't seen those yet, ask your lead.
