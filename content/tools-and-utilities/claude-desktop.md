## What It Is

Claude Desktop is a standalone app that gives you a dedicated workspace for working with Claude outside the browser. It's the main tool for non-engineering AI work and where most of the playbooks are executed.

## Getting Started

Download Claude Desktop and sign in with your team account. It's available for Mac and Windows.

## When to Use It

This is your default AI tool. Use it for writing, research, brainstorming, document review, problem solving, and any of the playbooks on this site. If you're not sure which tool to use, start here.

The desktop app is preferable to the web interface for longer sessions because it's a dedicated workspace that won't get lost in your browser tabs.
