## What It Is

Claude can connect to your Google Drive, giving it the ability to read documents, spreadsheets, slides, and other files without you having to download and upload them manually. When connected, you can reference Drive files in your conversations and Claude will pull the content directly.

## Getting Started

Connect your Google Drive through the Claude integrations settings. You'll authorize Claude to access your Drive, after which you can reference files by name or browse for them within a conversation.

## When to Use It

Any time you're working with documents that already live in Google Drive and you'd rather not copy-paste or download them first.

Loading a Google Doc into a conversation for review, editing, or summarization.

Pulling in a spreadsheet to analyze data, identify patterns, or generate a report.

Referencing shared team documents as context for a conversation, similar to how Claude Projects works but drawing directly from your existing Drive organization.

Working through the [Research Assistant](../playbooks/research-assistant.md) or [Meeting Prep](../playbooks/meeting-prep.md) playbooks where source material already lives in shared Drive folders.

This is especially useful when combined with [Claude Projects](claude-projects.md). A project can reference Drive documents as persistent context, so the AI always has access to the latest version of a file rather than a snapshot that was uploaded at a point in time.
