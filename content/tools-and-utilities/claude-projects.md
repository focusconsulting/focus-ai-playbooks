## What It Is

Claude Projects are shared workspaces where you can load in documents, guidelines, and prior work that persist across conversations. Everyone who has access to a project shares the same context, so the AI starts each conversation already understanding the background.

## Getting Started

Create a project from the Claude interface and add the relevant context documents. Invite team members who need access. Any conversation started within the project will have access to the loaded context.

## When to Use It

Projects are useful whenever a group of people are working on the same initiative and need the AI to understand the same background. A few scenarios where they fit well:

A team working on a proposal can load in the RFP, prior submissions, and company background so every conversation starts with that context instead of re-explaining it each time.

A working group producing a set of documents can load in style guides, templates, and completed examples so the AI stays consistent across everyone's sessions.

An ongoing project can maintain a project space where decisions, meeting notes, and key documents accumulate, giving the AI a richer understanding of context over time.
