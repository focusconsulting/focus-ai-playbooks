## What It Is

Claude for Chrome is a browser extension that lets Claude interact with whatever page you have open. Instead of copying and pasting content from a website into a Claude conversation, the extension lets Claude read the page directly and work with what's there.

## Getting Started

Install the Claude for Chrome extension from the Chrome Web Store and sign in with your team account.

## When to Use It

The extension is most useful for research and information gathering workflows where you're moving across multiple web pages and want to process what you're seeing without the friction of copying content back and forth.

Browsing LinkedIn profiles for meeting prep or proposal work and having Claude summarize backgrounds and identify what each person is likely to care about.

Reading through a set of articles or reports in the browser and having Claude extract key points, compare across sources, or answer specific questions about what's on the page.

Reviewing a company's website, product pages, or job postings to quickly build an understanding of their priorities and how they describe themselves.

This tool pairs naturally with the [Research Assistant](../playbooks/research-assistant.md) playbook. Where that playbook describes the overall approach to targeted research, Claude for Chrome is the tool that makes the source gathering step fast and low-friction.
