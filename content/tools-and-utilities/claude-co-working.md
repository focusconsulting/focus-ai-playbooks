## What It Is

Claude Co-working is a mode where Claude works on a task in the background while you do other things. Instead of going back and forth in a conversation, you describe what you need, hand it off, and come back to a result.

## Getting Started

Co-working is available through the Claude interface. Start a co-working session by describing the task you want completed. Claude will work through it and notify you when it's done.

## When to Use It

Co-working works best for tasks where you can clearly describe the desired output and don't need to steer the process interactively. Some examples:

Drafting a document from a detailed outline and set of notes.

Processing a batch of inputs into a consistent format, like turning a set of meeting notes into structured summaries.

Generating a report from data where the structure and analysis are well-defined.

If the task requires a lot of back-and-forth judgment calls or you're still figuring out what you want, a regular conversation in Claude Desktop is a better fit. Co-working is for when you know what done looks like and want to parallelize your time.
