# Focus AI Playbooks

A shared reference for how we use AI at Focus Consulting — the workflows that work, the tools we rely on, and the practices we've learned along the way. Start here when you're picking up a new AI tool, looking for a repeatable way to tackle a task, or want to see how others on the team are getting results.

This is a living document. If you've found a workflow that consistently produces good outcomes, or a trick that makes a tool click, add it. The more people contribute, the more useful this becomes for everyone.
